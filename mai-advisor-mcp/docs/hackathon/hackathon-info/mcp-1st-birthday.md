## 💰 Why MCP Matters More Than Ever

Since our June'25 hackathon, MCP has gone from experimental to mainstream:

* ✨ **OpenAI officially adopted MCP**, later announced Apps SDK built on top of it ([DevDay 2025](https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/))
* 🪟 **Microsoft integrated MCP into Windows 11** ([Build 2025](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/05/19/securing-the-model-context-protocol-building-a-safer-agentic-future-on-windows/))
* 🧠 **Google DeepMind joined the ecosystem** ([Demis Hassabis's tweet](https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1910107859041271977))

**MCP is no longer experimental—it's the foundation of modern agentic AI.** This is your opportunity to build on the protocol that's reshaping how AI systems connect to the world.
