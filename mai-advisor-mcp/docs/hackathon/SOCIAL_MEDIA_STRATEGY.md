# Social Media Strategy: MAI Advisor x Mukwa Miikana

This document outlines the social media strategy for the **MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon** submission. The goal is to demonstrate the real-world impact of **MAI Advisor** by showcasing how it supports **Mukwa Miikana**, an Indigenous-led non-profit.

## 🎯 Core Narrative

**"Empowering the Guardians of Turtle Island with AI."**
We are bridging the gap between grassroots organizers and institutional funding. Mukwa Miikana protects Mother Earth; MAI Advisor handles the bureaucracy of funding that protection.

## 🏢 Featured Organization: Mukwa Miikana

* **Website:** [mukwamiikana.org](https://www.mukwamiikana.org)
* **Mission:** Decolonized future, protecting Mother Earth, empowering the 7th Generation.
* **Locations:** Bemidji, MN & Michigan.
* **Social Handles:**
  * Twitter/X: `@MukwaMiikana`
  * LinkedIn: `Mukwa Miikana`
  * Instagram: `@mukwamiikana`

## 🏆 Track 1: MCP in Action (Enterprise)

**Focus:** The *workflow*. How the Autonomous Agent takes a simple goal ("Funding for Lake Superior protection") and turns it into a 90-day execution plan, saving hundreds of hours.

### 🐦 Twitter / X Thread

**Post 1 (The Hook):**
Grassroots orgs like @MukwaMiikana are busy protecting Mother Earth—they don't have months to chase grants. 🌍

For the @huggingface #MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon, we built MAI Advisor: An AI Agent that builds a 90-day funding strategy in 60 seconds. 🚀

**Post 2 (The Problem):**
Mukwa Miikana works across MN & MI to empower the 7th Generation. But finding grants for "Indigenous Environmental Sovereignty" is a full-time job.

Most small non-profits leave $100k+ on the table simply because they lack the *time* to search.

**Post 3 (The Solution - MCP in Action):**
Using the Model Context Protocol, we connected a Research Agent to a Grant Strategy Engine.

Input: "Indigenous Environmental Protection in Bemidji, MN"
Output:
✅ 50+ Targeted Search Dorks
✅ Financial Sustainability Plan
✅ 8,000-word Agent Execution Script

**Post 4 (The Result):**
See it in action. We generated a complete roadmap for Mukwa to secure micro-grants for their "Guardians of Turtle Island" initiative.

No hallucinations. Just actionable, structured data ready for their team.

**Headline:** How we're using AI Agents to fund Indigenous Sovereignty. 🌿

**Body:**
For the **MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon**, I'm proud to debut **MAI Advisor**—an enterprise-grade grant planning system built on the Model Context Protocol.

We partnered with **Mukwa Miikana**, an Indigenous-led organization in Minnesota/Michigan, to test it. Their mission is protecting Mother Earth and empowering the 7th Generation. Their challenge? Capacity.

Grant writing is a luxury many grassroots orgs can't afford.

**The "MCP in Action" Solution:**
We built a system where a single prompt launches a fleet of AI experts.

1. **The Strategist:** Defines the financial framework.
2. **The Researcher:** Generates "dorks" to find hidden funding.
3. **The Agent:** Writes a step-by-step browser automation script to apply.

In under a minute, we generated a 90-day funding roadmap for Mukwa Miikana's "Lake Superior Warriors" program.

This isn't just about code; it's about capacity. It's about giving the "Guardians of Turtle Island" the same administrative power as a large institution.

## 🛠️ Track 2: Building MCP (Enterprise)

**Focus:** The *tech*. How the MCP Server architecture allows Mukwa Miikana's data to be securely accessed inside Claude Desktop, turning a chat interface into a specialized grant workstation.

### 🐦 Twitter / X Thread (Track 2)

**Post 1 (The Hook):**
What if your AI assistant actually *knew* how to write grants? 🤔

For the "Building MCP" track, we turned MAI Advisor into a native MCP Server. Now, organizations like @MukwaMiikana can pull specialized funding strategies directly into @AnthropicAI's Claude Desktop.

**Post 2 (The Tech):**
We didn't just build a web app. We built a bridge. 🌉

By implementing an MCP Server, we exposed 3 core tools to Claude:
🛠️ `generate_dorks` (Finds the money)
🛠️ `get_financial_plan` (Budgets the money)
🛠️ `get_research_plan` (Proves the impact)

**Post 3 (The Use Case):**
Watch this workflow:

1. Open Claude Desktop.
2. Connect `mai-advisor-mcp`.
3. Ask: "Help me find funding for Mukwa Miikana's youth program in Bemidji."

Claude calls our local tools, retrieves the structured strategy, and instantly drafts the proposal text. Context-aware. Secure. Fast.

**Post 4 (The Impact):**
This allows Mukwa Miikana to keep their sensitive data local while leveraging LLM intelligence. It transforms a general chatbot into a specialized Development Director.

Code is open source on Hugging Face! 👇

### 💼 LinkedIn Post (Track 2)

**Headline:** Turning Claude Desktop into a Non-Profit Development Director with MCP. 🤖💰

**Body:**
As part of the **MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon** ("Building MCP" track), I explored how the Model Context Protocol can solve real workflow bottlenecks for non-profits.

I used **Mukwa Miikana** (a fiscal sponsored program of the Indigenous Environmental Network) as our test case. They need to move fast, and they need tools that fit *their* workflow, not another dashboard to log into.

**The Architecture:**
Instead of forcing them to a new website, I built **MAI Advisor** as an MCP Server.

* **Backend:** Python/FastAPI (Hugging Face Spaces)
* **Protocol:** MCP (Model Context Protocol)
* **Client:** Claude Desktop

**The Result:**
A Mukwa organizer can simply open Claude and ask: *"Draft a budget narrative for our new community garden in Bemidji based on our financial framework."*

Claude uses the `get_financial_plan` tool to pull the *exact* approved framework we generated, ensuring the budget aligns with their fiscal sponsorship rules. No copy-pasting. No context switching.

This is the future of enterprise AI: Specialized tools meeting users where they already work.
