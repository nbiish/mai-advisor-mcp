## II. Financial Management Framework

### Budget Development Strategy

**Cost Structure for Small Operations:**
- **Personnel (60-70%):** Core program and administrative staff
- **Operations (20-30%):** Facilities, technology, insurance, compliance
- **Program Delivery (10-20%):** Materials, supplies, participant support

**Key Principles:**
- Build budgets from activities, not arbitrary percentages
- Include true costs (don't underprice to seem competitive)
- Document all cost allocation methodologies
- Plan for indirect costs (10-15% typical for small orgs)
- Show in-kind and matching contributions clearly

### Multi-Source Revenue Diversification

**Strategic Funding Mix:**
- **Primary (60-70%):** Competitive grants (federal, state, foundation)
- **Secondary (20-30%):** Earned revenue, fees-for-service, partnerships
- **Tertiary (10-20%):** Individual giving, special events, corporate support

**Risk Mitigation:**
- No single funding source exceeds 40% of annual budget
- Multi-year grants provide stability
- Unrestricted funding supports infrastructure
- Operating reserves build financial cushion

### Operating Reserve Strategy

**Progressive Reserve Building:**
- **Year 1 Target:** 1-month operating expenses
- **Year 2 Target:** 2-3 months operating expenses
- **Year 3 Target:** 3-6 months operating expenses (financial stability)

**Reserve Use Guidelines:**
- Bridge timing gaps between grant payments
- Cover unexpected expenses or revenue shortfalls
- Support capacity investments (not ongoing operations)
- Provide runway for strategic planning

### Financial Reporting & Compliance Systems

**Essential Infrastructure:**
- Grant-specific accounting codes in chart of accounts
- Time-tracking for staff working across multiple grants
- File organization for receipts and backup documentation
- Reporting calendar with advance reminders (2+ weeks)
- Variance analysis process for budget-to-actual review

**Board Finance Committee Role:**
- Monthly financial review and variance analysis
- Quarterly cash flow projections
- Annual budget development and reserve assessment
- Policy review and risk management oversight
