## Grant Opportunity Assessment Framework

### Identifying the Right Opportunities for Small Organizations

**Federal Grant Considerations:**
- **Capacity requirements:** Do you have staff to manage complex reporting?
- **Match requirements:** Can you meet cost-sharing obligations?
- **Timeline:** Application to award often 6-12 months—can you wait?
- **Competition level:** Success rates typically 10-25%
- **Reporting burden:** Monthly/quarterly reports vs. annual
- **Best for:** Organizations with some grant experience, fiscal infrastructure

**Foundation Grant Considerations:**
- **Alignment:** Mission must clearly align with foundation priorities
- **Geographic focus:** Many limit to specific regions or communities
- **Relationship requirement:** Local foundations value community connection
- **Timeline:** Often faster (3-6 months)
- **Best for:** Smaller budgets, pilot programs, capacity building

**Corporate Giving Considerations:**
- **Employee engagement:** Programs that involve corporate volunteers
- **Measurement focus:** Clear, quantifiable outcomes
- **Quick turnaround:** Often annual cycles
- **Best for:** Community-visible programs, partnerships

### Opportunity Screening Checklist
Before investing 15-20 hours in an application, verify:
- [ ] Your organization meets all eligibility requirements
- [ ] You can meet match/cost-share obligations
- [ ] Timeline aligns with your program readiness
- [ ] Reporting requirements are manageable with current capacity
- [ ] You have capacity to apply while managing existing grants
- [ ] Mission alignment is authentic, not forced

## Strategic Grant Calendar Development

## Competitive Positioning for Small Organizations

### Leveraging Your Strengths

- Bring community stakeholders together
- Build capacity in the community, not just your organization

### Addressing Small Organization Concerns Proactively

**Limited Track Record:**

- Start with smaller pilot grants to build history
- Highlight community need and support even if org is young

**Capacity Questions:**
- Be honest about current capacity
- Show plan for building capacity with grant support

- Build multi-year funding relationships, not one-off grants

## Grant Proposal Narrative Development

### Writing Strategy for Small Organizations

**The "Goldilocks" Approach to Proposals:**
- Not too corporate (avoid jargon, stay authentic)
- Not too informal (maintain professionalism)
- Just right (clear, compelling, evidence-based with community voice)

### Core Narrative Components with Small Org Focus

**1. Need Statement (15-20% of proposal)**

*What to include:*
- Quantitative data about community need
- Qualitative stories that bring data to life
- Gap analysis: What's missing in current services?
- Geographic/population specificity
- Why this need matters now

*Small org advantage:*
- You know the community intimately
- You can provide specific, local data vs. national statistics
- Your stories are authentic, not manufactured

*Common mistakes:*
- Only national statistics without local connection
- Describing your organization instead of community need
- Assuming everyone understands why this matters
- Too much description, not enough analysis

**2. Program Design (30-35% of proposal)**

*What to include:*
- Clear activities with timeline
- Theory of change or logic model
- Staffing plan with realistic capacity
- Partner roles and commitments
- Cultural competency and community voice
- Adaptations for specific population needs

*Small org advantage:*
- Flexibility to be truly community-driven
- Direct service delivery (no layers of bureaucracy)
- Innovation without corporate constraints
- Authentic partnerships, not transactional

*Common mistakes:*
- Vague activities without clear implementation plan
- Overpromising what small team can deliver

- No clear timeline or phasing

**3. Outcomes & Evaluation (20-25% of proposal)**

*What to include:*
- SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

- Mix of quantitative and qualitative measures
- How you'll use data for continuous improvement
- Third-party evaluation if required/budgeted

*Small org advantage:*
- Close relationships with participants enable authentic feedback
- Can gather stories and testimonials naturally
- Rapid iteration based on what you learn

*Common mistakes:*
- Goals that aren't measurable
- Evaluation plan beyond your actual capacity
- Only tracking outputs (participants served) not outcomes (change created)
- Expensive evaluation that takes money from programs

**4. Organizational Capacity (15-20% of proposal)**

*What to include:*
- Leadership team experience (even if org is new, people aren't)
- Board composition and governance
- Financial management systems
- Past performance (or team's past performance)
- Quality assurance and oversight

*Small org advantage:*
- Direct leadership involvement in program
- Board members actively engaged (not just names)
- Personal accountability and mission-driven

*Addressing capacity concerns:*
- Fiscal sponsor arrangement if needed
- Technical assistance partnerships
- Board development plan
- Honest about growing capacity with grant support

**5. Budget & Budget Narrative (10-15% of proposal)**

*What to include:*
- Line-item budget matching all activities
- Budget narrative justifying every expense
- Cost-sharing or matching contributions clearly identified
- Sustainability plan beyond grant
- Reasonable indirect costs

*Small org considerations:*
- Shared staff allocations must be clearly documented
- In-kind contributions properly valued
- Don't underprice to seem competitive—value your work
- Show how grant builds capacity, not just sustains it
