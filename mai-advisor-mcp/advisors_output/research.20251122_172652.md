**Topic:** indigenous wellness  
**Location:** michigan

## Executive Summary
This framework provides research methodologies and evidence-gathering strategies specifically designed for small non-profit operations developing indigenous wellness. Focus is on leveraging existing data, demonstrating community need, and building evaluation capacity that funders value.

## Community Needs Assessment Framework

### Conducting Needs Assessment with Limited Resources

**Primary Data Collection (What You Gather Directly):**
- Community surveys (online tools: Google Forms, SurveyMonkey free tiers)
- Focus groups with target population (6-10 participants, 2-3 groups)
- Key informant interviews (community leaders, service providers)
- Community forums or listening sessions
- Photovoice or community mapping exercises

**Secondary Data Sources (Free/Low-Cost):**
- U.S. Census Bureau (American FactFinder, demographic data)
- County health rankings and roadmaps
- School district data (if education-focused)
- State/local government reports
- United Way community assessments
- Existing academic research

**Needs Assessment Questions to Answer:**
1. Who is the target population (demographics, geography)?
2. What specific needs exist (documented through data)?
3. What gaps exist in current services?
4. Why does this need matter now (urgency, trends)?
5. How did you involve community voice in identifying needs?

### Demonstrating Need Without Large-Scale Studies

**Small Organization Strategies:**
- Partner with local university for research support
- Leverage existing community assessments (don't duplicate)
- Combine quantitative data with compelling qualitative stories
- Use comparison data (national vs. local to show gap)
- Document waiting lists, referral patterns, community requests

**Common Mistakes:**
- Relying only on national statistics without local connection
- Describing your organization instead of community need
- Assuming everyone knows why this matters
- No community voice in needs identification

## Evidence-Based Practice Research

### Identifying Proven Models for Your Work

**Where to Find Evidence-Based Practices:**
- Federal clearinghouses (SAMHSA, What Works Clearinghouse, etc.)
- Academic databases (Google Scholar is free)
- Professional association best practice guides
- Peer organizations with evaluation data
- Technical assistance providers in your field

**Adapting Evidence-Based Models for Small Organizations:**
- Core components vs. optional enhancements
- Fidelity to model vs. community adaptation
- Resource requirements and scalability
- Training and technical assistance needs
- Cultural adaptation while maintaining effectiveness

**Documenting Your Approach:**
- Logic model showing theory of change
- How your approach aligns with evidence-based principles
- Adaptations made for your community context
- Plan for measuring fidelity and outcomes

### Building Your Own Evidence Base

**Even New Organizations Can:**
- Document program activities and participant engagement
- Track outputs (numbers served, hours of service)
- Gather participant feedback and satisfaction data
- Collect stories and testimonials
- Monitor short-term progress indicators

**Progressive Evaluation Strategy:**
- **Year 1:** Track participation, satisfaction, immediate outputs
- **Year 2:** Add outcome measurement with validated tools
- **Year 3:** Longer-term outcomes and impact assessment
- Ongoing: Use data for continuous improvement

## Competitive Landscape Analysis

### Understanding Your Service Environment

**Collaboration vs. Competition Framework:**
- Map existing services (who does what, for whom, where)
- Identify gaps (unserved populations, geographic areas, service types)
- Determine your niche (what makes you different/needed)
- Build partnerships rather than duplicate successful programs

**Questions to Research:**
1. What organizations provide similar services?
2. Who do they serve (and who do they NOT serve)?
3. What are their hours, locations, eligibility requirements?
4. Where are the waitlists or capacity constraints?
5. How can you complement rather than compete?

**Demonstrating Your Unique Value:**
- Population focus (cultural, linguistic, identity-specific)
- Geographic focus (neighborhood, rural area not covered)
- Service delivery approach (hours, location, format)
- Integration of services (wraparound, holistic)
- Community-driven governance and design

## Funder Landscape & Priorities Research

### Understanding What Funders Care About

**Federal Grant Trends (Research Before Applying):**
- Review previous year's abstracts of funded projects
- Attend bidders conferences and webinars
- Read agency strategic plans and priorities
- Join mailing lists for funding announcements
- Note match requirements and reporting expectations

**Foundation Research Strategies:**
- Use Foundation Directory Online (library access often free)
- Review foundation 990 tax forms (public record)
- Analyze foundation websites for stated priorities
- Identify recently funded similar projects
- Attend foundation information sessions

**What to Document:**
- Alignment between your mission and funder priorities
- Geographic restrictions (do you qualify?)
- Organization size and budget preferences
- Multi-year funding patterns
- Application deadlines and cycles

## Stakeholder Engagement & Community Voice

### Authentic Community Participation

**Meaningful Engagement vs. Tokenism:**
- Community members in leadership roles (board, advisory committee)
- Compensation for community expertise (stipends, gifts)
- Language accessibility and cultural responsiveness
- Multiple ways to participate (in-person, virtual, written)
- Act on community feedback (don't just collect it)

**Documenting Community Support:**
- Letters from community members (not just organizations)
- Results of community surveys or forums
- Photos and quotes from community events
- Partnership MOUs with community-based organizations
- Community advisory board meeting minutes

**Questions Funders Want Answered:**
1. Who designed this program (community-driven vs. imposed)?
2. How do you ensure cultural relevance and responsiveness?
3. What role do community members play in governance?
4. How will you be accountable to the community?

## Implementation Planning & Timeline Development

### Realistic Phasing for Small Organizations

**Pilot Before Scaling:**
- **Months 1-3:** Planning, partnership development, staff hiring
- **Months 4-6:** Pilot with small cohort, test and refine
- **Months 7-9:** Implement improvements from pilot learning
- **Months 10-12:** Document outcomes, plan for sustainability/scale

**Capacity-Appropriate Growth:**
- Don't over-promise what small staff can deliver
- Build in learning time and course correction
- Phase participant enrollment (don't flood capacity)
- Allow time for relationship-building (community, partners)

**Risk Identification & Mitigation:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| Staff turnover | Medium-High | Cross-training, documentation, succession planning |
| Lower than expected enrollment | Medium | Multiple recruitment strategies, partnerships |
| Partnership challenges | Medium | Clear MOUs, regular communication, flexibility |
| Delayed grant funding | High | Build reserves, seek advance payments, line of credit |

## Data Collection & Evaluation Framework

5. Extract key findings, limitations, implications

**Translating Research to Grant Proposals:**
- "Research shows [cite source]"
- "Evidence-based practices include [cite source]"
- "Our approach aligns with [theory/framework]"
- "Studies demonstrate [outcomes you expect]"

**Building Your Research Library:**
