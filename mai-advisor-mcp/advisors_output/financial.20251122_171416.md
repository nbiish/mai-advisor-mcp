## Executive Summary
This strategic framework provides proven financial management approaches specifically designed for small non-profit operations pursuing native american health. Focus is on building sustainable infrastructure, establishing transparent systems, and demonstrating fiscal responsibility to funders.

## Budget Development Framework

### Cost Structure Approach for Small Organizations
**Personnel (Typically 60-70% of budget):**
- Core program staff (director, coordinator, part-time support)
- Consider volunteer coordination to extend capacity
- Build in professional development allocations
- Plan for benefits if full-time positions created

**Operations (Typically 20-30% of budget):**
- Shared office space or donated facilities
- Technology infrastructure (cloud-based to minimize upfront costs)
- Insurance and compliance requirements
- Utilities and basic supplies

**Program Delivery (Typically 10-20% of budget):**
- Materials and participant supplies
- Transportation or accessibility support
- Community outreach and engagement
- Evaluation and data collection

### Sustainability Planning Framework

**Multi-Source Revenue Diversification:**
- Primary: Competitive grant funding (federal, state, foundation)
- Secondary: Earned revenue streams (fees-for-service, training, consulting)
- Tertiary: Community partnerships (in-kind, shared resources)
- Strategic principle: No single funding source should exceed 40% of annual budget

**Operating Reserve Building:**
- Start small: Target 1-month reserves in Year 1
- Build gradually: 2-3 month reserves by Year 2
- Mature stability: 3-6 month reserves by Year 3
- Use reserves strategically: Bridge funding gaps, not ongoing operations

**Financial Health Indicators Small Non-Profits Should Track:**
- Months of operating reserves available
- Percentage of budget from diverse sources
- Grant reporting compliance rate (target: 100%)
- Budget-to-actual variance (target: <10%)
- Program cost per participant served

## Financial Management Systems for Small Organizations

### Essential Infrastructure
**Chart of Accounts:**
- Set up program-based accounting from day one
- Track restricted vs. unrestricted funds separately
- Create expense categories that match common grant budgets
- Use cloud-based accounting (QuickBooks Online, Xero, or free options like Wave)

**Internal Controls (Even with Small Staff):**
- Dual signature requirement for checks/transfers
- Monthly bank reconciliation by someone other than bookkeeper
- Board treasurer reviews financials monthly
- Annual independent financial review or audit when required

**Grant Financial Management:**
- Create separate tracking for each grant award
- Set calendar reminders for reporting deadlines
- Document match requirements and in-kind contributions
- Track time allocation for staff split across multiple grants

### Board Finance Committee Role
**Monthly Responsibilities:**
- Review financial statements and variance reports
- Monitor cash flow projections
- Ensure compliance with grant restrictions
- Flag risks to leadership early

**Annual Strategic Planning:**
- Develop annual budget with realistic revenue projections
- Assess reserve adequacy
- Review and update financial policies
- Plan for sustainability beyond current grants

## Funder Fiscal Responsibility Expectations

### What Funders Look For in Small Organizations
**Financial Transparency:**
- Clear budget narratives that justify every line item
- Honest assessment of organizational capacity
- Documentation of financial management systems
- Board financial oversight evidence

**Cost Allocation Methodology:**
- Reasonable indirect cost rates (10-15% common for small orgs)
- Documented time-tracking for shared staff
- Clear methodology for allocating shared costs
- Consistency across all grant applications

**Sustainability Beyond Grant Period:**
- Articulate 2-3 year financial sustainability plan
- Show diversified funding strategy
- Demonstrate community investment (volunteers, in-kind, partners)
- Realistic earned revenue or fee-for-service plans

## Budget Development Process

### Needs-Based Budgeting Approach
1. **Start with Program Design:**
   - What activities will you actually deliver?
   - What staff time is required (be realistic)?
   - What supplies/materials are essential vs. nice-to-have?

2. **Personnel Calculations:**
   - Break down by position and % FTE (Full-Time Equivalent)
   - Include benefits (typically 20-30% of salary)
   - Account for professional development
   - Consider volunteer coordination time

3. **Non-Personnel Expenses:**
   - Facilities: Shared space, donated space, or lease?
   - Technology: Cloud-based subscriptions vs. purchased software
   - Supplies: Estimate per participant/per program cycle
   - Travel: Local vs. regional vs. conference attendance

4. **Indirect/Administrative Costs:**
   - Executive oversight (% of Executive Director time)
   - Bookkeeping and financial management
   - Fundraising/development activities
   - General liability insurance, compliance costs

### Budget Narrative Best Practices
- Justify every line item with clear reasoning
- Show how costs are calculated (unit cost × quantity)
- Explain any items that might raise questions
- Demonstrate cost-effectiveness and efficiency
- Reference community wage data for personnel
- Highlight cost-sharing or matching contributions

## Financial Reporting & Compliance

### Grant Reporting Timeline Management
**Create a Master Calendar:**
- List all grant reporting deadlines
- Set internal deadlines 2 weeks before due dates
- Assign responsibility for each report
- Track submission and funder acknowledgment

**Financial Report Components:**
- Budget-to-actual comparison with variance explanations
- Narrative on budget modifications if any
- Documentation of match or in-kind contributions
- Photos, testimonials, or outcome data supporting expenditures

**Common Small Organization Challenges:**
- Late reporting (damages funder relationships)
- Incomplete backup documentation
- Confusion about allowable expenses
- Poor communication about budget modifications

**Solutions:**
- Calendar automation and team notifications
- File organization system for receipts and documentation
- Read grant agreements carefully; ask questions early
- Submit modification requests proactively, not retroactively

## Risk Management Strategies

### Financial Risks Small Organizations Face
1. **Grant Payment Delays:**
   - Mitigation: Request advance or quarterly payments
   - Maintain line of credit for cash flow gaps
   - Build 30-60 day operating reserves
   - Communicate with funders about reimbursement timeline

2. **Underfunding of Indirect Costs:**
   - Mitigation: Develop federally-approved indirect cost rate
   - Advocate with funders for adequate overhead support
   - Seek general operating support grants
   - Build fundraising for unrestricted funds

3. **Staff Turnover Mid-Grant:**
   - Mitigation: Document all processes and procedures
   - Cross-train team members
   - Budget for recruitment and onboarding
   - Maintain good funder communication

4. **Scope Creep Without Additional Funding:**
   - Mitigation: Clear program design and boundaries
   - Written partnership agreements
   - Regular program review against original scope
   - Learn to say "no" to mission drift

### Contingency Planning
